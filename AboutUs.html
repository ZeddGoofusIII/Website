                    <p>Brendon is the mighty mind behind Equinumb. Brendon has been building this
                        website from the ground since 2016. It was a tough few years for him.
                      However, his business is finally ready to get our products into your
                       hands. Our CEO is committed to bringing you the absolute best customer 
                       experience you could ever ask for. He hopes to see you taking full advantage
                        of the great products he helped create.

                    <p>Our expert in the field of how these things work. You’ll often see her
                         come by for repairs if you report an unfamiliar problem with any product
                        you purchase. We trust not one other person more with this technology than
                        her. She will swing by to take a look even if she needs to take a flight
                        to get there. The need for an expert to be working no any new problem is
                         of the utmost importance.
